# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Project.

This is a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in Pytorch. 

Objective: Given an image of a dog, identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

This was a fun project from which I learned a lot. Some of the things I learned are:
  1. How to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
  2. Exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification.
  3. Making important design decisions about the user experience for the app.
  4. Understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data    processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
  5. How to tweak hyperparameters for optimal results.
